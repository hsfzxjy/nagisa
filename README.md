**nagisa** is a collection of common patterns and utilities in Python and PyTorch, with trade-off between abstraction and ease of use. The components are adopted from personal research projects, covering advanced state tracking, data processing, large-scale machine learning pipeline, and many other miscellaneous items. **nagisa** can be the scaffold of an project complicated as [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), or a good choice for your quick-start deep learning script.
